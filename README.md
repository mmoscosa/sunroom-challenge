# Sunroom Challenge

1. Create a new public repository in your personal GitHub account and Deploy a new ReactJS-based web application to a public server we can access, such as Heroku.

2. Re-create this application in ReactJS: http://minesweeperonline.com/, styled & themed however you like, prioritizing the features related to gameplay (leaderboards, persistence, etc are all bonus).

3. Before Tuesday at 2:00 pm CST, please send us a link to the application and the repository. We will set up a call afterwards to review together.
